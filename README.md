second-subtitle
===============

Minimal Javascript/HTML template to display subtitles on a second screen

Use case example: Film audio is in Japanese, subtitles are in Finnish, and I understand neither Japanese nor Finnish. I encode English subtitles into the .html file and open the page on a tablet beside the main screen.
